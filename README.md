# 🎮 Console Rhythm Game Using C Programming

A console-based rhythm game developed in **C programming language** that tests a user’s reaction time and rhythm accuracy using audible beep cues and real-time input handling.

This project is designed as part of the **SPC / AAT coursework** and is suitable for first-year engineering students to understand timing-based logic and interactive console applications.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The Console Rhythm Game presents rhythmic beats at fixed time intervals.  
The player must press the **SPACE key** immediately after hearing the beep sound.  
Based on the reaction time, the program evaluates the performance and awards scores.

The game includes:
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Audible rhythm cue using system beep
- Reaction time measurement
- Scoring and combo tracking
- Final performance evaluation

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔊 Audible beep rhythm using `Beep()`  
- ⏱ Accurate reaction time calculation using `clock()`  
- 🎚 Difficulty-based timing control  
- 🧮 Score and combo system  
- 🖥 Fully console-based (no external files required)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **C**
- Compiler: **GCC (MinGW)**
- IDE: **Code::Blocks / Dev-C++**
- Platform: **Windows**

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Open **Code::Blocks**
2. Create a **New Console Application**
3. Select **C** (not C++)
4. Replace the contents of `main.c` with the provided source code
5. Build and Run the program (**F9**)

⚠️ Make sure you are running on **Windows**, as the program uses `windows.h`.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level
2. Wait for the beep sound
3. Press **SPACE** immediately after the beep
4. Try to achieve the highest score and combo

---

## 📊 Output

- Displays reaction time for each beat
- Categorizes hits as **Perfect**, **Good**, or **Miss**
- Shows final score and maximum combo

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding real-time input handling
- Working with system clocks in C
- Implementing timing-based logic
- Using console input/output effectively
- Basic game logic design in C
